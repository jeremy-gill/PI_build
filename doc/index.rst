PI_build Docs
=============
This python package contains tools to automatically maintain version info for your other python
software packages that you keep in git repositories.  Tag your projects with names that look like
``vA.B.C``, and `PI_build` can be used to do the rest.  This package depends primarily on 
`dulwhich <http://http://www.samba.org/~jelmer/dulwich/>`_, which is used to directly query your software
repositories.
